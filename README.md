gastropod is a web page slug generator in the style of what.three.words

**_The words are kinda strange looking, how are they generated?_**
Glad you asked the words are randomly selected from a word bank provided by the [english_words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) repository namely the ```words_dictionary.json``` file.
